# Euclid

This service is capable of complex mathmatical calculations just like the ancient Greek mathmatician of the same name!

## ðŸ¤ºChallenge
You're tasked with designing a processing pipeline using Pulumi and AWS step functions. Your input is the following JSON blob as a string:

```json
{ "a": <number> "b": <number> }
```

Please build a step function definition that achieves the following:

Writes the json to a shared storage
Runs a ECS task that performs the following operation: a + b = c
Writes "C" to the same shared storage as a workflow output.
You can use any language you want within the ECS/docker container, at RISC Zero we mostly use rust but it's not a requirement for this.
